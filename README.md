> This image is sort of a "developer experience" or dx image plus some other low-hanging, useful additions on-top of [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg). 

#### Right now we ship:
- Racket
- VSCode
- Gh-cli, git-lfs
- Syncthing
- Rclone
- Restic


##### Next up
- Restructure so we have a `desk` and `deck` image.
  - Both need to have a dx (developer experience) version.
